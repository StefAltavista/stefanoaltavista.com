Since there is a big social movement in the realm of avantgarde, unconventional and extreme art, Noises wants to give a voice to the underdogs that have always been the foundation of our society and now need to reclaim their space. \n S.A.M has put together a team to further develope this platform, and it will soon be launched.",
